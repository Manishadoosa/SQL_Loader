# Excel to MySQL Loader with Flask

This application is a Flask-based web tool for uploading Excel files and dynamically inserting or updating data into a MySQL database. The application checks and alters the table structure in MySQL to match the columns in the uploaded Excel file, ensuring data integrity.

## Features

1. **Upload and Process Excel Files**: Upload Excel (`.xlsx`) files that contain data to be loaded into MySQL.
2. **Dynamic Table Creation and Alteration**: The app checks for existing tables and columns, creates new ones, or adds missing columns as necessary.
3. **Data Transformation**: Excel data is transformed into JSON format and sanitized for SQL compatibility.
4. **Row Updates**: Updates existing rows based on unique columns (e.g., `DATE`, `SUPPLIER_NAME`, `PRODUCT`).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MySQL Server with a configured `sql_loader` database
- Necessary Python packages (see [Installation](#installation))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install flask pandas mysql-connector-python
    ```

3. Configure the MySQL database with the following parameters:
    - Host: `localhost`
    - User: `root`
    - Password: `Root@123`
    - Database: `sql_loader`

   Modify these settings in the `db_connect()` function as necessary.

4. Ensure the `uploads` folder exists in the project directory for storing uploaded files.

## Usage

1. Start the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. Upload an `.xlsx` file. The application will read, process, and insert or update the data in the database.

## Code Structure

### Core Functions

- **`db_connect`**: Establishes a connection to the MySQL database.
- **`allowed_file`**: Checks the file type of the uploaded file.
- **`excel_to_json`**: Converts the DataFrame to JSON format suitable for SQL operations.
- **`get_sql_column_type`**: Determines SQL data types based on the column content.
- **`add_columns_if_not_exist`**: Adds missing columns dynamically to the database table.
- **`create_table_if_not_exists`**: Creates a new table if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
- **`insert_data`**: Inserts new data or updates existing rows in the table.

### Web Routes

- `/`: Home page with the upload form.
- `/upload`: Processes the uploaded file and loads data into MySQL.

### Configurations

- **UPLOAD_FOLDER**: Directory to store uploaded files.
- **ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS**: Set of allowed file extensions (currently only `.xlsx`).

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for file type validation, file reading issues, and database connection or query execution errors. Informative messages are provided on the web interface for troubleshooting.

## Future Enhancements

- Support additional file types (e.g., `.csv`).
- Add a robust logging system for debugging.
- Improve the interface with more detailed success/failure messages.
